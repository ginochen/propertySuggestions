    "# Approach\n",
    "Since the financial performance of regional storages aren't given, which can be the ideal predictand, let's make some assumptions for the predictand:\n",
    "  1. Assume uniform financial model (loss, cost, net gross profit, etc) for all units, and `accumulate the net cashflow by region`. Treat the problem as a multilinear regression problem by economic/demographic features predicting net cashflow. \n",
    "    - challenge is to define regions so to match the stats from the source we download the economic/demographic data.\n",
    "  2. Treat either regional population incomes or employment as the predictand since these are identified as good investment indicators for self-storage businesses. This will also allow continuous data modelling from the stats downloadable tables. This can become a multi-linear regression problem.\n",
    "    - challenge is we might be building a good model for predicting regional incomes or employments, instead of self-storage investment returns.\n",
    "  3. Use the table's given locations as good investment instances (1), and define the not given locations as bad investment instances (0). This will be a binary classification problem.\n",

    "## Understanding the financial model\n",
    "- The size of the property (rentable + non-rentable) of Table 1 is `450000/9 = 50000` square feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total gross annual income is `$472.5K` and `$9` per SF composed of two parts as a percentage of gross:\n",
    "    - Rent is about `95%`\n",
    "    - other incomes (source in question) is about `5%`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Since rent accounts for `95%` of the income, and consider the market share of PS, we really want to focus on **finding the demographic features that will boost the `annual rent`**. Let's put aside the source of other incomes for this project due to time limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The effective gross annual income is `$425.25K` after subtracting the `10%` loss by vacancy and collections. We don't want to assume `100%` occupancy. At the same time we might want to reduce the vacancy to boost the `annual rent`. Let's assume all `10%` of loss is by vacancy, and suppose the vancancy was reduced by `10%`. That translates to a `1%` gain by rent, which is pretty significant. Therefore **search for the features that reduces the vacancy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The annual expense as a percentage of the effective gross is composed of two parts: \n",
    "    - operating expense (source in question) is about `-33%`. \n",
    "    - debt service is about `-39%`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- The net cashflow before-tax is about `+28%` of effective gross.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's assume the debt service is uniform throughout the country. Here leads to the main question of finding the source of \"operating expense\" which can be broken down to: \n",
    "    - on-site or off-site management salaries, \n",
    "    - real estate taxes, \n",
    "    - insurance (building, liability, tenant, etc), \n",
    "    - repair and maintenance, utility (water, sewage, electricity), \n",
    "    - administration (phone, postage, bank charges, credit reports, legal services, data processing, etc), \n",
    "    - advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Developmental Cost \n",
    "The majority of the cost lies in two targets:\n",
    "- Land: the cost of land can really well relate to construction cost\n",
    "- construction & security:\n",
    "  - labor, \n",
    "  - weather variables (can be a predictor of climate controlled units at PS, e.g., humidity),\n",
    "  - removal of trees (GIS data of landscape),\n",
    "  - digging through dirt or stone\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regional economic factors\n",
    "As mentioned, the downturn and recovery phase of the economy can create opportunities for self-storage business, e.g., increasing the rent with higher moving rate. Here are few interesting features:\n",
    "- Population mobility\n",
    "- Consumer spending \n",

    "  - housing & vehicles\n",

    "  - healthcare\n",
    "  - retail sales\n",
